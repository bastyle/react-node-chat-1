For every one of those, there’s a team of professionals that maintain them. Everyone needs people that can fix a car, or do their plumbing, or renovate their home, or just maintain the equipment and vehicles we rely on every day. Joining a skilled trade will make you a member of a special, incredibly valuable and well-paid segment of the workforce, and build you a rewarding, creative career."
